## Project Description: BigMart Sales Prediction Analysis

**Objective:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast sales of various products across BigMart's store network. The model will leverage historical sales data (2013) for 1559 products sold across 10 stores in different locations. By identifying key factors influencing sales, BigMart can optimize product placement, pricing strategies, and inventory management.

**Data:**

The project utilizes a dataset containing sales information for various products sold at BigMart stores. The data includes:

* **Product Attributes:**
    * Item_Identifier: Unique product ID
    * Item_Weight: Weight of the product
    * Item_Fat_Content: Low fat or not (categorical)
    * Item_Visibility: Percentage of display area allocated to the product in a store
    * Item_Type: Product category
    * Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price of the product
* **Store Attributes:**
    * Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID
    * Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year the store was established
    * Outlet_Size: Ground area covered by the store
    * Outlet_Location_Type: City type (categorical)
    * Outlet_Type: Grocery store or supermarket (categorical)
* **Sales Data:**
    * Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in a particular store (target variable)

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Data cleaning techniques will be employed to address missing values and inconsistencies.
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn library will be conducted to understand data distribution and relationships between variables.
    * Feature engineering might be implemented to create new informative features from existing ones.
2. **Model Development:**
    * A linear regression model will be initially implemented to predict sales based on product and store attributes. 
    * The performance of the model will be evaluated using relevant metrics.
    * Depending on the results, exploration of alternative machine learning models like Random Forest or XGBoost may be considered.
3. **Model Deployment:**
    * The final chosen model will be deployed to predict sales for new product-store combinations.

**Expected Outcome:**

* A well-performing model that accurately predicts product sales across BigMart stores.
* Identification of key product and store characteristics that significantly influence sales.
* Improved decision-making for product placement, pricing strategies, and inventory management at BigMart.

**Future Work:**

* Explore the use of more advanced machine learning models for potentially higher prediction accuracy.
* Develop a web-based application to facilitate real-time sales prediction for BigMart employees.
* Analyze the impact of promotional activities and seasonality on sales through time-series analysis.
